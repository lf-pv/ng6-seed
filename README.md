# ng6-seed

## install factory
1. Choose your version of the factory, by choosing a branch.
  -  `master`: everything
  -  `core`: only well formed scaffolding && basic features (CoreModule, apiService, basic router outlet)
  -  `core+lang`: core + a fully integreted translation system with `@ngx-translate/core`
  -  `core+store`: core + a redux `@ngrx/store` fully angular compliant, with examples 
  -  `core+auth`: core + a classic register/login/user/logout token based auth.
  -  `core+lang+store`: @see above 
2. Create a new folder for your project. Copy every files and folders except `node_modules`, `dist`, `package-lock.json`
3. In your project, modify package.json project name, and other infos (you can replace ng6-seed by your project-name everywhere)

## serve & build app

To serve, run `npm i && npm start` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`

To build (prod AOT), run `npm run build` and deliver the fresh generated `dist` folder

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component <component-name>` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Running unit tests

To launch unit-tests: `npm test`, it will automatically run the `json-server` dep as a pre/post hook 

In case of error, `json-server`will continue to run, so you can run `ng test`and debug your tests

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests.

## add a new feature in the store

* Navigate to the root of the store `cd src/app/store`
* Then generate a new feature: `ng generate feature <name> --reducers reducers/index.ts --flat false`
* Then generate a custom service if needed `ng g service store-<name>`. 
WARNING: This service wil be 100% dedicated to help the store freture concerned, and nothing else.
* Finally:
  - add new effect in `src/app/store/store-effects.index.ts` list 

@see documentation  https://github.com/ngrx/platform/blob/master/docs/schematics/feature.md
